# This file is read case insensitively. Each line binds a keypress to an event
# generator. Multiple keypresses can be bound to the same event if you want.
# The editor needs to be exitted and reloaded for changes to take effect.
#
# Each line has three mandatory arguments:
#   key - The key binding
#   object - The object to send the event to
#   command - The event type
#
# flags is an optional argument that states one of two properties:
#   global - The event should be sent even if the object doesn't have GUI focus
#   passThrough - The key presses should not be gobbled up, but left for other
#                 events
#
# The rest of the line is a free format string that different objects treat
# differently. If you have a specific question about this aspect, you should
# ask a question on the forums on the deadfrog.co.uk website.
