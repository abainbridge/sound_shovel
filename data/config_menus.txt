# This file is read case insensitively. Each line binds a menu item to an event
# generator. Multiple menu items can be bound to the same event if you want.
# The editor needs to be exitted and reloaded for changes to take effect.
# If a keypress is bound to the same event as a menu item, the keypress combo
# will be displayed in the menu item automatically.
#
# Each line has four mandatory arguments:
#   menu - The name of the menu (new menus are created automatically)
#   label - The menu item text
#   object - The object to send the event to
#   command - The event type
#
# key is an optional argument that states which index in "label" should be
# used for the keyboard accelerator (ie the character that appears underlined
# and will cause the item to be executed if that letter is pressed when the
# menu is displayed). If key is not specified, a default of 0 will be used.
# If two items attempt to use the same key, the first item in the list will
# succeed, and the second item will have not key assigned. Setting key to
# -1 will disable the key accelerator for any item. This is useful if you
# want an item lower in the menu to use the key that would otherwise be
# taken by default.
#
# The rest of the line is a free format string that different objects treat
# differently. If you have a specific question about this aspect, you should
# ask a question on the forums on the deadfrog.co.uk website.
